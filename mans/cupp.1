.SH DESCRIPTION
CUPP(Common User Passwords Profiler) is tool to generate wordlist from common user profiler. The most common form of authentication is the combination of a username and a password or passphrase. If both match values stored within a locally stored table, the user is authenticated for a connection. Password strength is a measure of the difficulty involved in guessing or breaking the password through cryptographic techniques or library-based automated testing of alternate values.
.PP
A weak password can also be one that is easily guessed by someone profiling the user, such as a birthday, nickname, address, name of a pet or relative,or a common word such as God, love, money or password. From a social engineering you can obtain information to use with the CUPP, this way the tool can create a very effective dictionary for brute force attacks or dictionary attacks.
.PP
That is why CUPP has born, and it can be used in situations like legal penetration tests or forensic crime investigations.
